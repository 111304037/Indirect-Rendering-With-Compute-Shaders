# Unity3D-HierarchicalZBufferOcclusionCulling
An implementation of the Hierarchical Z-Buffer Occlusion Culling using Unity3D, compute shaders and Indirect drawing

The project shows you how to:
- Draw things using Graphics.DrawMeshInstancedIndirect
- Frustum cull in a compute shader
- Shadow cull in a compute shader
- Occlusion cull with HierarchicalZBuffer in a compute shader
- Use distance based LOD'ing
- Use Append buffers
